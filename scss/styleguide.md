This is the styleguide information of the FAYA Corporate website and we would love to call this as **FAYA Visual Language** AKA **FVL**. FVL is a reference point for designing FAYA corporate website across Web, Mobile, and Tablet devices. The main aim of FVL is to make sure each and every reusable components behave consistantly.
